# ROCKPro64 Nextcloud setup

A comprehensive, step-by-step journal documenting how to set up a self-hosted Nextcloud server on a Pine64 ROCKPro64 running Armbian Linux.

This guide walks through:

- Choosing and preparing hardware, including repurposed old PC parts for a DIY NAS
- Installing and configuring Armbian Linux
- Setting up Docker and deploying Nextcloud
- Network setup, security, and SSL configuration
- Troubleshooting and optimization for a privacy-focused, fully functional cloud solution

Perfect for anyone looking to build their own secure, self-hosted cloud storage using affordable SBCs and DIY components.

## Motivation

1. **Privacy and Control** – I wanted a cloud solution where my data stays under my control, without relying on third-party services.
2. **Repurposing Old Hardware** – I had old PC parts lying around and wanted to give them a second life as a DIY NAS.
3. **Learning and Experimentation** – Setting up Nextcloud on Armbian allowed me to deepen my understanding of Linux, Docker, networking, and home server management.
4. **Customizability** – Running my own server gives me the flexibility to tailor the system to my needs, from storage structure to security measures.
5. **Cost-Effective Solution** – Using affordable hardware like the Pine64 ROCKPro64 and existing parts made this a budget-friendly way to host my own cloud.

Building this server has been both a practical project and a learning experience, resulting in a secure, private, and fully functional cloud solution for personal use.
